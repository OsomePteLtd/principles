# General Testing Principles

## Strategy

Our testing approach is not a ▲ "testing pyramid" but a 🏆 "testing trophy". That means:

1.  integration tests must be the majority
1.  unit tests can be used if needed only for the corner cases of the scenarios covered by integration tests
1.  E2E tests are considered as smoke tests
1.  Static programming language helps to avoid too many tests for every corner case
